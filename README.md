# Unnamed Parkour Game

This is a small prototype that aims to create a parkour movement system that is similar to Apex Legends and the Titanfall series. It is created in Unity and initially utilized translational movement before being swapped to a rigidbody based movement system.

# Features
- Simple momentum based movement
- Momentum conservation (an attempt of it, at least)
- Momentum gaining (via slopes or slides)
- Sliding and slide jumping
- Double jumps similar to Ash's dash or Octane's extra jump (more similar to Ash, as it adds forward momentum)
- Wall Bouncing, Tapping, and Running (*TBA*)

# Key Learnings

The following are what I've learned from this challenge:
- Rigidbodies
- Parkour Level Creation
- A lot of rigidbodies...

# Tech used

This project uses the following:
- Unity
- C#
